The Charleston area is a year-round feast for the senses. Spring smells like tea olive, summer is salty breezes, fall tastes like slow-cooked collard greens, and winter is a hearty bowl of shrimp and grits. While certain aspects of Lowcountry life are constant no matter what the time of year – the rustle of palmetto fronds, crashing surf and the peal of church bells – each season ushers in unique sensations.

When azalea buds burst with color, spring is officially sprung and doors open at scores of private residences for the Historic Charleston Foundation’s annual tour of houses and gardens. The sound of standing ovations says it’s late spring, and Spoleto Festival USA and Piccolo Spoleto – the annual compendiums of acclaimed international and regional artists – enliven the area’s theaters, churches, parks, galleries, sidewalks and event venues with 17 days of performances.Sand between the toes means summer is in full swing, and family vacations are unfolding at area beaches. The scent of oysters roasting beneath wet burlap is synonymous with fall. Come during the Christmas season to experience some of the USA's most historic homes and beloved plantations illuminated with candlelight, starlight and the sounds of spiritual music.No matter what the month, there’s always something special waiting to be discovered.
