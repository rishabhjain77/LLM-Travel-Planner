Just 84 kilometers from the eastern entrance to Yellowstone National Park, at the foot of the Absaroka Mountains, you’ll find William F. “Buffalo Bill” Cody’s namesake town. The intrepid Western showman moved through this area in the 1870s and loved it so much he came back 20 years later to wrangle a town out of the rugged Rocky Mountain landscape, and what a town it is for you to explore. You’ll find Cody just a six-hour drive from other popular Western U.S. destinations including Mount Rushmore National Memorial in South Dakota and Salt Lake City, Utah.
