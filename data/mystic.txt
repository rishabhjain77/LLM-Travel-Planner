Since the ancient days of Pequot Indian habitation, the village of Mystic has centered on maritime resources and commerce. Today, visitors to Mystic will find a quintessential New England destination dominated by nautical landmarks and attractions.

Maritime LegacyMystic Seaport has an enormous collection of historic watercraft, including the 19thcentury Charles W. Morgan, the USA’s only surviving wooden whaling ship, and the USS Nautilus, the first nuclear-powered submarine.Board the schooner Argia for a cruise into Long Island Sound; the sunset sail is especially memorable. See the popular beluga whales at the Mystic Aquarium.Famous Pizza and Other EatsThe 1988 coming-of-age movie “Mystic Pizza,” starring Julia Roberts, was indeed based on a real restaurant in Mystic. Grab a slice along with a bit of Hollywood history. Of course, this maritime town is also known for its great seafood. During warmer months, eat dinner in a treehouse (yes, a treehouse!) at the Oyster Club. Elsewhere, get fresh oysters paired with a freshly pulled pint at one of the many historic seafood restaurants and pubs.Touring the LandmarksFor a small village, Mystic is overflowing with must-see attractions. Set aside a few hours to explore historic downtown and its quaint shops. Have your camera ready as the impressive Mystic River Bascule Bridge is raised. Eat, drink and shop at the small businesses in Olde Mistick Village. Spend some time exploring the hiking trails, exhibits, nature and wildlife at the Denison Pequotsepos Nature Center. Before you go, be sure get a picture at the cool wooden anchor in Liberty Pole Square.
