Once a frontier settlement in the Wild West, San Antonio has become a city full of modern amenities. As one of the top shopping destinations in the nation, San Antonio offers upscale boutiques, multiple shopping malls and the largest Mexican market in the USA. The city is also famous for its scenic River Walk, which makes getting around downtown a breeze. Stretching more than 24 kilometers from start to finish, the River Walk’s shaded pathways connect hundreds of shops, restaurants, hotels, historic landmarks, museums and attractions. It’s also the setting for many of the city’s annual festivals and events featuring food, wine, live music and more.

With a unique culture stemming from its Spanish, German and American roots, San Antonio offers an abundance of history, arts and exciting cuisine. Take the River Walk to the north and you’ll find museums filled with everything from Picassos to Western memorabilia and the Pearl, an exciting culinary and shopping destination. To the south, the River Walk leads to four Spanish missions that once provided shelter for frontier settlers and still provide some of the best bird watching spots around. Perhaps most notable of all San Antonio’s missions is the Alamo in the heart of downtown. The Missions and the Alamo have been named a World Heritage Site by the United Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO).Just a short way outside of downtown, you’ll find five theme parks, more than 50 golf courses, one of the largest zoos in the USA, the largest caverns inTexasand hiking and biking trails stretching into theTexas Hill Country, a region quickly gaining recognition for its wineries. All in all, San Antonio is one unforgettable city where you’ll never run out of things to do. If you ever need a suggestion, just ask one of the friendly locals.
