The name of Kansas’ capital city, Topeka, is said to mean “a good place to dig potatoes” in the Kansa-Osage Native American language. The city doesn’t produce many potatoes anymore, but it is home to a diverse selection of attractions, restaurants and events focused on history, art and adventure.

A Place in HistoryTake a tour of the 1903 Kansas State Capitol building and admire the ornate architecture and murals by noted painter John Steuart Curry.
