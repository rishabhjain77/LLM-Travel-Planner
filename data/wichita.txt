The largest city in Kansas earned the “Cowtown” nickname in the late 1800s, when cattlemen used the Chisholm Trail to drive herds to the city for easy access to railroads. Wichita has changed immensely since that time, but it still maintains some reminders of its ranching past. In addition to fascinating historic museums, the cosmopolitan city now offers more than 1,000 restaurants, eight shopping districts and numerous attractions, theaters and festivals.
